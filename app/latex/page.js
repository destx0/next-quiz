If $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{8}{17}$, then find the value of $\\tan \\theta.$







**Given:**  \n\n$\\sin \\theta = \\frac{8}{17}$  \n\n**Concept used:**  \n\n(H)Hypotenuse$^2$ = (P)Perpendicular$^2$ + (B)Base$^2$  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n\n![Image](https://storage.googleapis.com/tb-img/production/23/08/F3_SSC_Arbaz_8-8-2023_D16.png)  \n\n$\\sin \\theta = \\frac{P}{H}$  \n\nSo, $H^2 = P^2 + B^2$  \n\n$$17^2 = 8^2 + B^2$$  \n\n$$\\Rightarrow 289 = 64 + B^2$$  \n\n$$\\Rightarrow 225 = B^2$$  \n\n$$\\Rightarrow 15 = B$$  \n\nNow,  \n\n$\\tan \\theta = \\frac{P}{B}$  \n\nSo, $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{8}{15}$  \n\n**∴ The required answer is $\\frac{8}{15}$.**  \n\n**Shortcut Trick**  \n\n$\\sin \\theta = \\frac{8}{17} = \\frac{P}{H}$, we know the triplet $P = 8$, $B = 15$, $H = 17$  \n\nNow, $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{P}{B}$ So, $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{8}{15}$


1. Exploit as the letter I comes before R  \n\n5. Explore as the letter R comes before S  \n\n2. Explosive as the letter L comes before O  \n\n3. Exponent as the letter N comes before S  \n\n4. Exposition  \n\n**Hence the correct answer will be '1,5,2,3,4'**  \n\n![Image](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/twABWZnY3muDwCowDsdlV1r7ParN7RJnj4lamMERPi82cLaOIlHwEyY1mzmLa7HSp6goONyeYzjeo2AWQwuUIVQ5XQ4VFCeais8DIAaQ4nkyDdR9SM_l8KH3cLAtNcfe7-xlIwDX=s0)

Bhangra is the dance form of Punjab.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThe dance form of Uttar Pradesh is **Kathak**.\n\nHence, **‘kathak’** is the correct answer.\n\n![Image of Confusion Points diagram](https://storage.googleapis.com/tb-img/production/21/07/Confusion%20Points_Sunny_28.7.21.png)\n\n**The differences between kathak and Kathakali.**\n\nBoth styles are parts of Indian classical dance, but both come **from different states of India.**\n\n**Kathak** had evolved from north Indian states Jaipur, Banaras, or Lucknow, which are also known as Gharanas, and the **Kathakali** has come from the south Indian state Kerala which is known as home to several traditional classical dances.\n\nSo the conclusion about Kathak or Kathakali dance is that both are different dance styles, but most people think both styles are the same because of the pronunciation sound of these styles.





	The pattern followed is,\n\n**Logic:** In each row,\n\n**3rd number = \\frac{(1st number + 2nd number)}{2}**\n\n1st row → $\\frac{(27 + 61)}{2} = 44$\n\n2nd row → $\\frac{(44 + 52)}{2} = 48$\n\nSimilarly, we have:\n\n3rd row → $\\frac{(69 + 43)}{2} = 56$\n\nHence, **56** is the correct answer.


Select the number which can be placed at the sign of the question mark (?) from the given alternatives.\n\n| 27 | 61 | 44 |\n|----|----|----|\n| 44 | 52 | 48 |\n| 69 | 43 | ? |\n






The pattern followed here is:\n\n![Alpha chart](https://storage.googleapis.com/tb-img/production/21/09/alpha%20teb.png)\n\nAccording to the alphabetical positions of the letters,\n\n**Logic is:** Sum of the place value of the letters $\\times$ Number of letters in the word\n\n![Formula for SEND](https://storage.googleapis.com/tb-img/production/21/09/F1_Chitranshi_27-09-21_Savita_D3.png)\n\nSEND = $19 + 5 + 14 + 4 = 42 \\times 4 = 168$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n![Formula for PURSE](https://storage.googleapis.com/tb-img/production/21/09/F1_Chitranshi_27-09-21_Savita_D4.png)\n\nPURSE = $16 + 21 + 18 + 19 + 5 = 79 \\times 5 = 395$\n\nHence, '**395**' is the correct answer.

# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. One of the core principles is the famous Schrödinger equation:

$$
i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\left [ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right ] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)
$$

Where:
- $\\Psi$ is the wave function
- $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant
- $m$ is the mass of the particle
- $V$ is the potential energy

Another important concept is the uncertainty principle, often expressed as:

$$
\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}
$$

This principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position $x$ and momentum $p$, can be determined.

*Figure 1: Illustration of Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, a famous paradox in quantum mechanics.*

The above image illustrates the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, which highlights the strange nature of quantum superposition.

In quantum mechanics, the state of a particle can be described as a superposition of different states. For example, the spin of an electron can be represented as:

$$
|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|\\uparrow\\rangle + \\beta|\\downarrow\\rangle
$$

Where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers satisfying $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$.
